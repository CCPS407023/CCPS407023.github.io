    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm working toward multiple things in both my personal and professional life, in my personal life I'm working towards a future where my family are able to live financially well off, and in my professional life I'm working  towards being a chef, the experiences to make me want to go down this career path is the way I grew up, by growing up in a restaurant that my family owns and runs.

The way I'm working towards my goals is by learning new things, some of the things I learn is new recipes, new styles, new ingredients, also by slowly increases my speed in the way I work.

The values I think are needed for success are somewhat summarized in "pursuit of excellence" but that isn't my main value, my main value is you must have a hard work ethic in any career, either the career that I'm working towards or any career in general.

My short term goal that I hope to accomplish is to learn at least 20 new recipes in a year with this I can use it as a stepping stone to achieve my whole dream.

I want to be known for being a person who was able to learn how to cook food from every culture and place in the world as well as the natives there, and the character traits I want to be known for is a hard working person. </p>
